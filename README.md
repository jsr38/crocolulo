Alligator Board expansion for >= 3A stepper motors


This repository contains hardware designs for an Alligator expansion board that replaces the Piggy.

My CoreXY 3D printer [savagecorexy](https://github.com/jsr38/savagecorexy) is currently fitted with Alligator Board electronics.  This expansion board allows an Alligator Board to neatly interface with 6 external high current stepper drivers as well as bring out analogue IO pins to a header for experimentation or further customisation.
